## Primary Requirements: 
Meets All the primary engine and game requirements for Alc 1.

For Alc 2, it does not have a menu and the collision debugger is not fully implemented.


## Secondary Requirements:
Alc 1, the viewport supports zooming and panning very well, only issue arises when you try to interact with units while zoomed. Again no menu yet.

Alc 2, none of the secondary requirements met :(

## Extras:
Unit sprites are animated, (not implemented in the best way.)
